    | still providing an easy way to force download of new versions of files.
    |
    | Change this hash to invalidate asset caches.

    | or the rewrite rule will need to be modified to match the used pattern.
    |
    | If set to null urls will not be rewritten effectively disabling the package.

    | a new hash.

    | If all of the assets you want cached are in a directory you may limit
    | the caching to only that directory.
    |
    | If this is set you must also modify the rewrite rule.
    | For example if your assets are all inside a directory named "assets"
    | Set this value to "assets" and modify the rewrite rule to
    | RewriteRule ^assets/[a-f0-9]{32}/(.*)$ assets/$1 [L]
    |
    | You can also prefix urls to avoid clashes with any laravel routes.
    | For example if you have a route that begins with a md5 hash
    | this package will prevent that route from working normally.
    | To get around this set this prefix to a unique value that wont appear
    | in any of your routes.
    | Say you want to use the prefix cachedasset
    | Set the rewrite rule to the following
    | RewriteRule ^cachedasset/[a-f0-9]{32}/(.*)$ $1 [L]
